lecture 5:
Convolutional Nerual Networks were presented. Basically they work by laying a filter
with shared parameters over every region of the image. Usually there are multiple
filters applied. Each of them represents an actiovation map.
Depending on filter size, the distance when to apply, and the
dealing with the edge of the image determines the new dimension of the picture.
The edges are usually dealed with adding 0. These Filters are applied in all colour
channels. Pooling or the filter can be applied to downsize the image. There is
a trend to go away from pooling. The complete conv net usually exists of many layers
of convolution, pooling and fully connected, with ReLu. The trend is to make
them deeper.
It is copied from the human vision system. The experiment with cats, where they
showed them edges. Every filter works as a neuran firing for this region.
