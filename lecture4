lecture 4:
In this lecture the Backpropagation algorithm was presented in detail. Basically
we learned, that instead of directly computing the whole direvative for all entries,
we can modulize this in a computational graph, which makes it easier.
1) What are the effects of sum, mul, max on backprob?
The gradients can also be done for vectors, in this case they become jacobians.
